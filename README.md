# Dear visitor, welcome to Dev Drones application!

---
This manual explains how to run application and tests locally.
Before we start it is important to accept some assumptions:
- medication is always unique (combination of weight and name) and thereâ€™s no need to check if it exists in DB or not
- PSQL is used for logging storage for the purpose of simplification of the test app, in a real project it's better to use Kafka with infinite retention or Elastic

This application allows to:
- register a drone
- show all drones
- show all available for loading medications drones
- check drone battery capacity
- check drone's medication load
- load particular drone with medications

Original task could be found in `INITIALTASK.md`.

### Running an application using IDE
There is an option to run an application in an IDE, but in this case it required to run PostgreSQL database by your own and set parameters of your database in application.yaml file:
```
datasource:
url: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL:jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/devdronesdb}
username: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME:postgres}
password: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD:dockerpassword} 
```

`-DliquibasePostgre.path=src/main/resources/liquibase/changelog.xml`
